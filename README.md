# Pivotal Cloud Foundry Meetup Code Samples

## What These Are.   

If you recently attended a meetup where a demo was given using Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) - the source code for the demo is here.

Depending on the meetup, you might have seen a demo using Java, Ruby, Go, PHP, Node.js or Python.

All of the languages are available in this repo under the respective directory.

**All of the sample code used is in this repo, and is provided "as-is" for demonstration purposes only.**

##Using The Samples.

The fastest way to get up an running is to create a (free) account on [Pivotal Web Services](http://run.pivotal.io "PWS").

These samples will also work on your own PCF installation.
